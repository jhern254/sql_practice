### Puzzle 1
Prep in oracle
```
-- not working?
INSERT INTO Cart1 (Item)
    WITH temp AS (
        SELECT 'Sugar' FROM dual UNION ALL
        SELECT 'Bread' FROM dual UNION ALL
        SELECT 'Juice' FROM dual UNION ALL
        SELECT 'Soda' FROM dual UNION ALL
        SELECT 'Flour' FROM dual
)
SELECT * FROM Cart1;

INSERT INTO Cart1 
VALUES ('Sugar');
INSERT INTO Cart1 
VALUES ('Bread');
INSERT INTO Cart1 
VALUES ('Juice');
INSERT INTO Cart1 
VALUES ('Soda');
INSERT INTO Cart1 
VALUES ('Flour');




INSERT INTO Cart2
    WITH temp AS (
        SELECT 'Sugar' FROM dual UNION ALL
        SELECT 'Bread' FROM dual UNION ALL
        SELECT 'Butter' FROM dual UNION ALL
        SELECT 'Cheese' FROM dual UNION ALL
        SELECT 'Fruit' FROM dual 
)
SELECT * FROM Cart2;

INSERT INTO Cart2 
VALUES ('Sugar');
INSERT INTO Cart2 
VALUES ('Bread');
INSERT INTO Cart2 
VALUES ('Butter');
INSERT INTO Cart2 
VALUES ('Cheese');
INSERT INTO Cart2 
VALUES ('Fruit');


```

my solution
```
SELECT 
    c1.Item AS "Item Cart 1",
    c2.Item AS "Item Cart 2"
FROM Cart1 c1
    FULL OUTER JOIN Cart2 c2 ON c1.Item = c2.Item
ORDER BY (CASE -- CASE c1.Item 
             WHEN c1.Item = 'Sugar' THEN 1
             WHEN c1.Item ='Bread' THEN 2
             WHEN c1.Item ='Juice' THEN 3
             WHEN c1.Item ='Soda' THEN 4
             WHEN c1.Item ='Flour' THEN 5
             WHEN c2.Item ='Butter' THEN 6
             WHEN c2.Item ='Cheese' THEN 7
             WHEN c2.Item ='Fruit' THEN 8
        END)
;

```


### Puzzle 2


```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #Employees;

CREATE TABLE Employees
(
EmployeeID  NUMERIC PRIMARY KEY,
ManagerID   NUMERIC,
JobTitle    VARCHAR(100),
Salary      NUMERIC
);

INSERT INTO Employees VALUES
(1001,NULL,'President',185000);
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES
(2002,1001,'Director',120000);
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES
(3003,1001,'Office Manager',97000);
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES
(4004,2002,'Engineer',110000);
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES
(5005,2002,'Engineer',142000);
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES
(6006,2002,'Engineer',160000);


```


my sol.
```
-- rank based on man. id?
SELECT 
    JobTitle,
    
FROM Employees 
    



```



### Puzzle 4
DDL 
```
CREATE TABLE Orders
(
CustomerID      INTEGER,
OrderID         VARCHAR(100),
DeliveryState   VARCHAR(100),
Amount          NUMERIC,
PRIMARY KEY (CustomerID, OrderID)
);

INSERT INTO Orders 
WITH temp AS (
    SELECT 1001,'Ord936254','CA',340 FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 1001,'Ord143876','TX',950 FROM dual UNION ALL 
    SELECT 1001,'Ord654876','TX',670 FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 1001,'Ord814356','TX',860 FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 2002,'Ord342176','WA',320 FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 3003,'Ord265789','CA',650 FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 3003,'Ord387654','CA',830 FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 4004,'Ord476126','TX',120 FROM dual 
)
SELECT * FROM temp;

```

my sol
```
-- cte sol.
WITH ca
AS
(
    SELECT DISTINCT CustomerID
    FROM Orders
    WHERE DeliveryState = 'CA'
)
SELECT od.*
FROM Orders od 
    JOIN ca ON od.CustomerID = ca.CustomerID     
WHERE od.DeliveryState = 'TX'
ORDER BY od.OrderID
;
-- works


-- listagg sol
WITH ca
AS
(
SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    CASE WHEN 
        (LISTAGG(DeliveryState, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY CustomerID) LIKE '%CA%' 
        AND LISTAGG(DeliveryState, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY CustomerID) LIKE '%TX%')
            THEN 'Y'
        ELSE 'N'
    END AS Deliveries
FROM Orders
GROUP BY CustomerID
)
SELECT od.*    
FROM Orders od 
    JOIN ca ON od.CustomerID = ca.CustomerID     
--WHERE ca.Deliveries LIKE '%CA%' AND ca.Deliveries LIKE '%TX%'
WHERE Deliveries = 'Y'
    AND od.DeliveryState = 'TX'
ORDER BY od.OrderID
;
-- works

```
This is a nice sol. using ListAgg from Oracle analytic fns.


### Puzzle 5
DDL 
```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS PhoneDirectory;

CREATE TABLE PhoneDirectory
(
CustomerID  INTEGER,
Type      VARCHAR(100),
PhoneNumber VARCHAR(12),
PRIMARY KEY (CustomerID, Type)
);

INSERT INTO PhoneDirectory 
WITH temp AS (
    SELECT 1001,'Cellular','555-897-5421' FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 1001,'Work','555-897-6542' FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 1001,'Home','555-698-9874' FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 2002,'Cellular','555-963-6544' FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 2002,'Work','555-812-9856' FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 3003,'Cellular','555-987-6541' FROM dual 
)
SELECT * FROM temp;

```

my sol.
```
SELECT * 
FROM PhoneDirectory
PIVOT (
    MAX(PhoneNumber)
    FOR Type
    IN (
        'Cellular',
        'Work',
        'Home'
    )
)
ORDER BY CustomerID
;

```
Other solutions too based on outer joins/ joins
