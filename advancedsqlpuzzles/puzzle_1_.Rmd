INSERT INTO Cart1 (Item)
    WITH temp AS (
        SELECT 'Sugar' FROM dual UNION ALL
        SELECT 'Bread' FROM dual UNION ALL
        SELECT 'Juice' FROM dual UNION ALL
        SELECT 'Soda' FROM dual UNION ALL
        SELECT 'Flour' FROM dual
)
SELECT * FROM Cart1;

INSERT INTO Cart1 
VALUES ('Sugar');
INSERT INTO Cart1 
VALUES ('Bread');
INSERT INTO Cart1 
VALUES ('Juice');
INSERT INTO Cart1 
VALUES ('Soda');
INSERT INTO Cart1 
VALUES ('Flour');




INSERT INTO Cart2
    WITH temp AS (
        SELECT 'Sugar' FROM dual UNION ALL
        SELECT 'Bread' FROM dual UNION ALL
        SELECT 'Butter' FROM dual UNION ALL
        SELECT 'Cheese' FROM dual UNION ALL

VALUES ('Sugar');
INSERT INTO Cart2 
VALUES ('Bread');
INSERT INTO Cart2 
VALUES ('Butter');
INSERT INTO Cart2 
VALUES ('Cheese');
INSERT INTO Cart2 
VALUES ('Fruit');


```

my solution
```
SELECT 
    c1.Item AS "Item Cart 1",
    c2.Item AS "Item Cart 2"
FROM Cart1 c1
    FULL OUTER JOIN Cart2 c2 ON c1.Item = c2.Item
ORDER BY (CASE -- CASE c1.Item 
             WHEN c1.Item = 'Sugar' THEN 1
             WHEN c1.Item ='Bread' THEN 2
             WHEN c1.Item ='Juice' THEN 3
             WHEN c1.Item ='Soda' THEN 4
             WHEN c1.Item ='Flour' THEN 5
             WHEN c2.Item ='Butter' THEN 6
             WHEN c2.Item ='Cheese' THEN 7
             WHEN c2.Item ='Fruit' THEN 8
        END)
